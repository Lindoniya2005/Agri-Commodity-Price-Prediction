🔍 Project Overview:
This project aims to assist farmers, traders, and agri-business stakeholders by providing data-driven price predictions to support informed decision-making. 
The system uses a linear regression model trained on synthetic but realistic data and offers a user-friendly interface for real-time predictions.

🚀 Features:
🌡️ Input-based predictions using temperature, rainfall, and yield
📈 Clean and responsive UI with price trend visualization (Chart.js)
🌐 Multilingual support (e.g., English, Tamil, Hindi)
🌙 Dark and light mode toggle for better user experience
🔧 Flask backend for real-time ML model deployment
📂 Modular code structure with automated data pipeline

🛠️ Tech Stack:
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Chart.js
Backend: Python, Flask
Machine Learning: scikit-learn (Linear Regression)
Data Handling: Pandas, NumPy (synthetic dataset)

📌 Limitations:
Static CSV data (no live market or weather API integration)
Basic model (Linear Regression only)
Hardcoded commodity options
No evaluation metrics displayed (e.g., MAE, RMSE)
